A) The strategies for persisting the above data in a table are:

- Map the entire class hierarchy to a single table
- Map each concrete class to its own table
- Map each class to its own table

C) The Strategy I could use is table per class because attributes/fields in concrete class never change often. This strategy gives us a good database normalization, as it cuts off the unwanted nullable and and removes duplicate columns.
